[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a powerful tool for static sites and 
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is the first choice to pack assets. 

**Jekpack** is the integration of Jekyll and Webpack to make them work together ❤.

You may never hear about Jekyll or not familiar with Webpack. It's ok to get started Jekpack👌. 
Start learning Jekyll by using Jekpack.

Jekpack is for multi pages static sites. 
If you prefer the SPA(single page application), 
Webpack + HtmlWebpackPlugin might be another better choice 👈.
